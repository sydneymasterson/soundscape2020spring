After having to restart my assignment, I decided to switch gears. My new project begins in a very familiar situation. For simplicity’s sake I will refer to the person the soundscape follows as X. Person X starts their car, opens the garage door and backs out. The car changes to drive and accelerates. Now that X is set, they can begin looking for a radio station. Here I put an audio recording of switching through real stations I have programmed into my car. A few songs are heard but because it is for such a short time, they fall under fair use. X turns the radio off when they hear a police siren come on in the distance and pleads “not me.” A familiar feeling for anyone who drives. Once the siren passes her, X relieves “sweet!” Now the radio comes back on, and X’s focus again switches to finding the right station. This also utilizes another recording I made of the same stations and the songs once again fall under fair use. Unfortunately, while X’s focus in on the radio, things take a sudden turn. A car horn (recorded by myself) is heard in the background but X is still flipping through stations. Then, a loud crash. Brakes skid, another crash. Then all becomes silent and all we hear is the sound of X’s ears ringing. Eventually, we also hear X conscious and rapidly breathing. I still have to come up with an ending for the soundscape as well as fix up from rough spots including the skipping in the ear ringing sound and the jumping of different audio levels. I also think I want to go back and rerecord the voice of X because I cannot stand the sound of my own voice. I also think the crash seems a little forced so I would like to find a way to make it seem a little more real and have a more emotional or shocking effect on the listener.
